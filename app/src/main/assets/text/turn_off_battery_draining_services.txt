 <h5>Turn Off Battery-Draining Services</h5>
Slide from top off your screen to the
bottom of your home screen will give
you Quick Options. These options vary
from ringtone to power-savers like
GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile data, and
airplane mode.

If you are not going to be using Wi-Fi
or GPS in the near future, this menu
makes turning it easy to turn off these
power-draining services.
