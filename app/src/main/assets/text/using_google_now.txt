 <h5>Set it up right</h5>
Make sure you have set Google Now up
correctly before you begin exploring.
Firstly, get Google Now to recognize
your "oK Google" command from any
Screen by tapping the hamburger menu
icon in the Google app.then go to
 Settings Voice > OK Google detection.
 Here you just slide all the toggles to the
right.
Once that's done, you'll be prompted
to train Ok Google to your device, which
you do by saying OK Google" three
times.
Next, head over to Settings> Voice
Offline speech recognition  and make
Sure all the languages you need have
been downloaded. This way, you can still
use Ok Google commands that dont
require the internet when you' re offline.
If you trust Google enough to give it
access to your location data, you wiIl
open up a lot or great google Now
features. To let Google Now use your
location data, go to the Google settings
app, choose Location and make sure it's
set to On. Next, go to Google Location
History at the bottom or the same page
and set this to On, as well.
While you are at it, go into the Google
app, press on the hamburger menu icon
and then go to Customize. in here, you
can set your home and work addresses,
which can be used to set reminders and
get information about your commute.
You can also enter your favorite sports
teams, which modes of transport you
use, and more, to get the most useful
and interesting cards showing up

<h5>Learn all the Ok Google voice
Commands</h5>

Google Now OK Google offers hundreds
or Voice Commands that Can be Used to
achieve a whole host of operations. the
more you how, the more you will get
Out of G0ogle Now.
 <h5>Use location-based reminders</h5>
If you have to remember do something
in a certain place, but you're not sure
what time you'll be there, you can ask
Google to remind you once it detects
that you are there. this can be useful for remembering
what you need to buy when you arrive
at the shop, or that you need
to turn the oven on ds soon as you
arrive home, Tor example.
 <h5>Let it help you with travel arrangements</h5>
If you use Google Calendar, Google
Now will provide you with cards
and notifications that let you know
beforehand what time you should leave
at to arrive at an appointment on time.
These notifications even account for
traffic Conditions, making you a more
punctual and effective human being.
Make sure you have your preferred
mode of transport selected  (Customize > transport)  and
then head into  settings> NOW cards
 and SWitch Commute and Time to Leave on.

 <h5>Use it to track packages or flights</h5>

If you receive flight confirmations
and delivery tracking information to a
Google email account that is linked to
Google Now, these emails will be used
to provide cards that track packages
and update you on your flights status.
The same can be done for any flight
by searching for the flight number. If
you have web history enabled, Google
Now will create a dedicated card for the
flight.

<h5> Ask follow-up questions</h5>

Google Now is pretty good at
contextualizing what you say. If you
have asked, "How large is California?",
for example, you can ask a follow-up
question such as "How many people
live there?" and Google should have
no problems remembering that "there"
refers to California.
 <h5>Launch apps</h5>
Google Now has always been there
to provide a hands-free experience,
so why continue to use your fingers
to laboriously open apps? Simply say
"Open [app name]" and let Google do it
for you!
