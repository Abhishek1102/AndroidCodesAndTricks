<h5>1. Reduce the Number of Concurrent
Apps to Stop Phone Hang</h5>
Each mobile phone comes has a limited
amount of resources like memory (RAM)
and processing power. If you Overburden
the phone beyond the capacity of these
resources, the phone may hang. So, you
should try and minimize the number
of concurrently running apps. There
are a number of apps that run in the
background. You can free the clogged
memory by stopping the apps that you
don't need at present.

To see the list of currently running apps,
go to Settings> Apps > Running App .

<h5> 2. Keep All the Apps Updated</h5>
Keep visiting the app stores like Google
Play (if you have Android phone)
and iTunes App Store (if you've an
iPhone). Mobile app developers keep on
improving performance of their apps.
Therefore it is highly recommended that
you regularly update all the apps as and
when a better version is available. Latest
versions of apps may be designed to
use lesser memory and CPU power.

 <h5> 3. Shut Down Your Mobile Phone</h5>
Shutting down your phone every once
in a while is a good idea because it
wll completely refresh the memory
of phone. when you will restart your
phone, it memory will be free of all the
unnecessary pieces of data that were
Tingering on and occupying the memory
space
<h5> 4 Install Apps in External Memory (SD card)</h5>

Most of the mobile phone users install
all sorts of apps in their phones. When
installing the apps, they don't pay much
attention to where the app Is going
to be installed and what impact it can
have on the performance of the phone.
In most cases, by default, the apps
get installed in the, internal memory
or the phone. Inis leaves lesser space
ror the running the apps and that in
turn causes clogged memory. If your
phone hangs, it is advisable to install
apps in the external memory (1.e. SD
Card) of the phone. Usually the external
memory Is larger than the internal
memory. And external memory can also
be easily expanded ir required (instead
of 2 65 card, just insert an 8 65 card!).
Ihererore, in external memory more
apps can be easily instaled without
clogging, the internal memory of the
phone. his will save your phone from
hanging.

For this you can set the default write
disk. Go  to Settings > Storage > Default
write disk > Select SD Card.  Please note
that this setting is available in slightly
different location in different mobile
handsets, So. vou may have to do a bit
of look around.

 <h5> 5. Move Installed APps from Internal to
External Memory</h5>
 You can always move the already
installed apps from internal to external
memory. As explained above, this Will
give more internal memory space for the
smooth running or the apps. AS a result
your phone will not hang. Setting for
moving installed apps is usually available
under settings> Apps.

<h5> 6. Delete Unnecessary Apps<h5>
You can also browse through the list
of the apps installed in your phone.
You might spot a few apps that you
had installed once upon a time put you
no longer require them. Uninstall such
apps immediately. They stay idle in
your phone and waste the all important
memory space.

 <h5> 7. Delete Unnecessary Data (like photos,
Videos, Songs)</h5>
 It you have stored images, videos and
songs in the internal memory; you're
really choking up the internal memory
Space and that could very well become
the cause of your phone hanging all
the time. Go ahead, take a look at all
the pictures, videos and Songs and
delete the ones that you no longer
need. Alternatively, first you can take
backup of this data in your computer
and then delete It from your phone.
Photos, Videos and audio take up most
or the space the phone or an average
Smartphone user. And it is one of the
common reasons why your phone
hangs.


<h5> 8. ldentify Resource Hogging Apps</h5>
Some of the apps use much more
memory than other apps. game apps
(like Angry Birds) are among the top
memory guzzling apps. You can check
how much memory each of your apps
are using. For this go to settings Apps
(or Memory)> Running Apps.  Here you
will be able to see which app is using
exactly how much memory.
Memory usage by various apps in
Android.
if possible, you may try a lighter
alternative of an app that Is using a lot
or memory. For example, It you use a
news app and that app is eating up a
lot of RAM; you may consider removing
that app and install another news app
from the app store.

 <h5> 9. Install Antivirus Software</h5>
Viruses are a menace. If your mobile
phone is playing host to a virus, the
Virus can considerably slow down your
moblie phone. Neediess to say, you
phone Will hang often. So, obviously
you need an anti-virus. Although
anti-virus software itself take up a lot of
memory but it is better to have the virus
removed.

 <h5> 10.Give External Memory Some
Breathing Space</h5>
So far, we have been telling you about
importance of installing apps on external
memory . bit it should not mean that
you choke up the external
memory as well Keep some space free
in external memory also so that apps
Can easIiy store and read their relevant
data. If external memory is also full to
the brim that can also become the cause
of phone hang.
