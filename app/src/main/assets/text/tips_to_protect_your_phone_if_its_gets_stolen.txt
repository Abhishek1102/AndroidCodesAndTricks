<h5>1. Use a lock screen</h5>
We know: using lock screens used to
be a pain in the backside when all you
wanted to do was see if you'd received
any email. But now that you can use
lock screen widgets there's no reason
not to lock your phone properly with a
Code, fingerprint, gesture or face. Newer
Android devices come with fingerprint
Scanners for a good reason: they keep
your device secure, and are conveniently
quick. Not using a lock screen is the
Android equivalent of going out and
leaving your front door open for
burglars.

 <h5>2.Hide your passwords</h5>
Android's Settings > Security menu has
an option to make all passwords visible,
and while it means well it makes
entering accurate passwords simpler
- it's a security risk if you're entering
passwords where you can be seen, for
example when you're on the train or in a
crowd. This one's best left disabled.

 <h5>3.Hide and lock your apps</h5>
A good app locker can be a real
godsend not just for security reasons
but for privacy protection and, to ensure
kids can't wipe or move anything
important. A locker such as AppLock
can keep others Out or your photos
Contacts, Facebook, your phone settings
and anything else you might not
appreciate them meddling With.

<h5> 4.Track your phone with Android Device
Manager</h5>
This is more of a "what to do it you did
not protect  your phone" tip: if it's lost
or misplaced, android device manager
can find it remotely lock it and in worst
case scenarios, remote location tracking or
location services on your device , through
as if you do then ADM will not be able to
find it if it goes missing.

 <h5>5.Configure location services properly</h5>
Make sure your device is tracking GPS
properly: if it is not, it will be much
harder to track With something like
Android Device Manager if you misplace it.

<h5>6.Check your app notifications and
settings</h5>
A recent report found that ten of the
most popular, flashlight apps were
asking for ridiculous amounts of power
including the ability to track your
location and even deleting apps and
files. And of course it's not Just flashlight
apps: lots of dodgy downloads are
designed to harvest users data or con
them into handing over financial details
or actual money. Make sure you're on
top of your apps permissions

<h5>7. use messengers with encryption</h5>
If your device encryption is on by
default - that is, Scrambling your data in
such a way it can't just be copied and
looked at that doesn't mean the data
you send over the internet is encrypted.
To ensure your communications
are private. use an encrypted
platform Such as Telegram, whatsapp.
facebook messengers etc. rather than
unencrypted alternativesS.

<h5> 8.Install updates</h5>
Sometimes app updates are minor
things that make no noticeable
difference to anything at all, but
Sometimes those updates contain
essential fixes for security problemns
that you can't see but that potential
attackers can. People who do not
update to the latest versions remain
vulnerable, so its a very good idea to
stay up to date With app and Android
updates.

<h5> 9.Pin the screen</h5>
It you want to let Somebody read
something- such as an AndroidPIT
article in our app but don't want
them jumping into something else,
Screen pinning, which first appeared
on Android Lollipop, locks the display
to a single app. It isn't the most secure
thing in the world it tells you how to
undo it again right there on the Screen
- but at least it prevents your friends
or colleagues from accidentally nosing
around your device. If they do it, you
know they did it deliberately.
