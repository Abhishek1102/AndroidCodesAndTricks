 <h5>Turn off Android location tracking</h5>
Open Settings

Scroll down to Location You'll see
an on/off switch in the top right. Use
this to turn location services on or
off altogether.

<h5>Tap on Location> Google Location History</h5>
 Once again there's a button
in the top right that lets you turn
your location history on or off If you
also want to delete your location
history, you can do that here too:
under Location History tap Delete
Location History. Once deleted this
information can't be recovered.

 <h5>Enable Guest Mode on Android</h5>
Swipe down from the top of thee
Screen to pull down the notifications
bar.
Tap your avatar on the top right
twice
Now you will see three icons your
Google account, Add guest and Add
user.

Tap Add guest.
Now your smartphone will switch
to guest mode. This may take some
time and the phone may be slightly
slow initially, but in our tests with a
Nexus 5 it worked well after a few
minutes.

When you are done with guest
mode, you can easily revert to your
Google account. Follow steps 1 and
2 above and tap the icon that shows
your Google account. This will delete
all data saved in the guest session as
well.

If your smart phone doesn't have
Android 5.0 Lollipop installed, you
should check for a pre-loaded guest
mode that you can access by going
to Settings> General > Privacy>
Guest MOde.

 <h5>Stay away from fraudulent App</h5>

kind of app
