Now select and "stop" the application
which is unnecessarily running and
draining your device battery

your battery is dying too quickly, it
might be because of background apps
that you forget are running. Beefing up
your battery life can be easier than you
think.

<h5>Navigate to Settings>>Apps>>then
swipe to the running tab</h5> . You'll see the
apps that are using the most processing
and battery power. If you don't use a
high-power app very often, simply tap
the app and then tap the quit button.
Getting rid of energy-sucking apps
should give you a small boost to your
battery life.
