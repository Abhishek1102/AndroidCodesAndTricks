 <h5>Make sure you're up to date</h5>

The latest software will often contain
bug fixes and general improvements
and it can help your Android device
to run better. Software updates tend
come Over the Air and you should
be automatically prompted to install
them, but it doesn't hurt to check.

<h5>Go to Settings> About device
Software update  and check for
updates.</h5>

The same logic applies to apps
so fire up the Play Store, open the
menu at the top left and tap My
apps and make sure all of the apps
you use are up to date.

 <h5>Clean up your home screen</h5>
If you choose to use live wallpaper
then consider replacing it with a
good static image. You should also
clean away any unused icons and
limit yOur widgets to the essentials.
The less cluttered your nome
Screen is, the better in terms of
performance


 <h5>Uninstall and disable unused apps</h5>

you don't want to allow apps that
you never use to take up ace on
your device and potentially eat into
system resources. Go to Settings
Apps  and swipe over to the All tab.
Take a good long look down the list
and identify the apps you don't want
or need. If you're in doubt about
what any of them do then it's time to
hit Google and check.

Tap on any app you don't want
and then choose Uninstall or, if the
option is not there to uninstall, tap
Disable. Disabled apps will be listed
in a new tab, so you can always
enable them again in future if you
change your mind.

Ou should also take a look in
Settings > Apps  at the Running
tab. Some apps want to be running
all the time and they can seriously
impact on performance. Think
carefully about whether you need
what's listed there.

 <h5>Turn off or reduce animations/<h5>
You can make your Android device
feel snappier by reducing or turning
off some of animations. You'll need
to enable Developer options in
order to do this. Go to Settings >
About phone  and scroll down to
the System section to look for Build
number.
tap on it seven times and you
should see a message about being a
developer. You can now go back to
the previous menu and you should
see Developer options listed under
System. Head in there and scroll
down to find Window animation
scale, Transition animation scale, and
Animator duration scale. tap each in
turn and set it to.5x or off. Pick an
option and find out what suits you,
if you don't like just go back in and
change the values again.

 <h5>Clear cached app data</h5>
Cached data for apps should help
them to load more quickly, but it can
build up over time to take up quite a
lot of space and there will potentially
be cached data in there for apps
that you no longer use. Sometimes
clearing cached data for an app can
also help clear up flaky behavior.

If you want to pick individual apps
then head into  Settings> Apps  and
slide over the All tab and tap on
the relevant app then choose Clear
Cache. If you've decided to just clear
the whole lot then go to  Settings>
Storage  and tap on Cached data and
then tap OK.

 <h5>Turn off or reduce auto-sync</h5>
Most of us end up adding a list
of different accounts to our
Android devices and we allow
them to automatically sync in the
background to pull in new data
and provide us with updates. All
this syncing has a big impact on
performance, not to mention battery
life.

You could go to Settings and find
Auto-sync under Accounts and
just turn it off altogether, but that
will be too drastic for most people.
Instead why not just reduce the
sync frequency and remove any
accounts you dont really need? For
a lot of apps, like Facebook, you'll
need to open up the app and find
the settings to reduce the sync
frequency.

 <h5>Wipe cache partition</h5>
The cache partition is separate from
your app data cache and it contains
temporary files. It's worth cleaning
this out every once in a while. You'll
have to boot into recovery mode
to do it. The method of entering
recovery mode varies depending on
your device, but you'll find it easily
with a quick Google search. Once in
recovery mode you use the volume
keys to navigate and the power
key to select an item. You'll want to
choose wipe cache partition.

 <h5>Perform a factory reset</h5>
this is a drastic step, but some
people recommend that you do
a factory reset periodically if you
want yOur devIce running in good
Condition. It's a shortcut to cleaning
up your device and getting rid or
any Junk you've accumulated, but
it means wiping all of the data and
Settings. if you decide to try it then
make sure you back up everything
that's important to you first. You can
find the option to do it in Settings>
Backup & reset> Factory data reset.
