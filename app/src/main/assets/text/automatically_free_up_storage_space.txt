<h5> Automatically Free up Storage space</h5>
To ensure that you don't run out of
storage space on your Android device
with photos and videos that have been
already backed up, Google includes
a handy 'Smart Storage' option. The
feature ensures that when the system
Storage space is running low, the OS
can delete your backed up photos and
videos to free up space automatically.
This feature only works when you have
set Google Photos to automatically back
up your photos and videos.
To enable Smart Storage, head over to
 Settings -> Storage -> Manage Storage.
Make sure to enable the Smart Storage
 option from the menu that opens up.
You can also decide whether the feature2
should delete photos that are 30, 60 or
90 days old from the Backed up photos
& videos option.
If you want, you can also manually free
up storage space by using the free up
space now option.
