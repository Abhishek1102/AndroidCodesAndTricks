<h5> Backing up to your
Computer</h5>
<h5>1. Using Android File
Transfer</h5>
 Instead of backing up your device to
the cloud or to the phone itself, you
might want to back up all your files
to your computer for easy access
later on. Luckily, this is pretty easy
to do, and the process is pretty
much tne same whether you're a
Mac or PC user. Mac users will need
to download and install the Android
File Transfer app, though.

to a computer

with your USB cable.

and open the phone' s storage.

to a folder on your computer.

is quite Clunky and doesn't always
do the job. If manually copying

the computer. The premise is simple
install an app on your phone and
select a folder to keep an eye on
constantly. Meanwhile, a client runs
on your computer, allowing you to
link up with your phone.

phone detects a change or file
addition in a watched folder, it
immediately sends over a copy to
the computer. Simple and reliable. It
Just works. Of course, you can use
it as a standard sync utility too, but
I prefer to have all my files sent one
way to the computer to have a copy
available even if i delete something
from my phone.
