 Set up automatic phone unlock
Smart unlock is a new feature in
Android 5.0 Lollipop and higher one
android operating systems. It removes
your phone's PIN or pass code in certain
locations you trust, like home or work.
Go to Settings > Security > Smart Lock
Trusted places and add to trusted
places.

If your device is running Android 4.4
KitKat, there is a smart work around for
this. Enable installation from third-party
apps by going to Settings> Security>
selecting Unknown sources.
