<h5>Add Hard To Type Words</h5>
Hard-to-type words can be the bane of
any on-screen keyboard users existence.
Especially if they are not in your phone
dictionary. The process of adding it into
your phone can be difficult, with many

It will be highlighted and underlined, but
if you continue holding your finger over
the word the underline will eventually
go away. You can also manually enter a
word into your dictionary by tapping the
add to dictionary button that will appear
in the text box.

This actually means that the word has
been added to your dictionary. No muss,
no fuss.
