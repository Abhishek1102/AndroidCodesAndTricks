 <h5>Add your second Language</h5>
If you are equally fluent in two
languages, then Android provides you
the facility to give input in both the
languages, which is obviously a great
feature for bilingual users and also
frequent travelers.
To make use of the multi-locale
feature, open Settings > Languages &
input> Language preferences,  then
select Add a language and finally pick
your second language from the list of
available languages. Then after, you
can easily change the language in the
on-screen keyboard by pressing globe
or long-pressing spacer key.
