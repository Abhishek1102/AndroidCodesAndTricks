 <h5>The Facts About Android
That You Should Know.?</h5>
Android has been around for
a little Over a decade and a lot
has changed since the its early
days.Android is a Mobile Operating
System that was released on 23,
September 2008. Android is free,
Open-source operating system and
is based on modified version of
Linux kernel.open Handset Alliance
(OHA) developed the Android and
google commercially sponsored it. It
is mainly designed for touchscreen
devices such as smartphones and
tablets. Android is supported on
different platforms like 32- and 64-
bit ARM, x86, and x86-64. Android is
available in more than 100 languages
with Graphical (multi-touch) as the
default user interface. What started
as a simple operating system has
become a powerhouse spanning
across Countless devices and form
factors. The history of Android is an
interesting story. You might think
you know everything there is top
know about Android, but we've got
following things you probably didn't
know about. Check it out!
<h5> 1. Google didn't create
Android</h5>
Nowadays Google and Android
are synonymous with each other,
but you may be surprised to find
out that was not always the case.
Android was founded in 2003 by
Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears,
and Chris White. The founders
had strong ties to T-Mobile. Andy
Rubin created the ultra-popular -
Mobile Sidekick, and Nick Sears
Was vice president at T-Mobile. So,
you can see why T-Mobile landed
the first Android phone. It wasn't
until 2005 that Google acquired
Android Inc. Rubin, Miner, and
White all stayed with Android
through the acquisition. Together,
they developed what we now
know as the Android OS, in fact,
Rubin's nickname is where the
name "Android" came from. Many
people consider Android to be one
of Google's best acquisitions and 10
years after the acquisition, Android
has ballooned to control 88% of the
smartphone OS market share.
<h5> 2. Many critics thought
Android would fail
miserably</h5>
Android is nearly universally praised
nowadays, but back in the day
critics were much more skeptical. At
the time of Android's emergence
the iPhone was still relatively fresh
while Microsoft and Blackberry
were busy leading the way in
Smartphones. The idea of a web
search and email company making
phones didn't seem like a slam
dunk. In late 2008 during a round
table discussion about mobile the
question was asked we have to talk
about Android, right?" A member
from Pandora adamantly responded
"Why? Why do we have to talk
about Android nobody cares.
Obviously Pandora eventually Wised
up and created an Android app.
 <h5> 3. the first android prototype
looked like a blackberry</h5>
 many people believed that if it wasn't
for the iphone the first
Android device would have looked
drastically different than the T
Mobile G1 (HTC Dream). In 2007,
before Apple showed off the original
iPhone, the first Android prototype
was already floating around. The
device-codenamed "Sooner"
had a portrait keyboard, call and
end buttons, track pad, and no
touchscreen at all. The Android
Ul even closely resembled the
Blackberry interface. Of course,
all that changed once the iPhone
was announced. It was so different.
There was no physical keyboard,
only a big display for its time
and a revolutionary touchscreen
interface. The next Android device
we'd see after that the T-Mobile
G1 would also have a big display
with a touchscreen interface. The
BlackBerry-esque prototype? It
never came to market. We can't
say for certain that the iPhone had
any effect on Google's vision for
Android, but it wouldn't be out of
the question. Journey of ANDROID

<h5> 4. Android 1.0 and 1.1
weren't named after
desserts</h5>
For a long time Google has been
nicknaming new versions of
Android with desserts. At the time
of this article we are at Android
5.0 Lollipop, and before that it
was KitKat, Jelly Bean, Ice Cream
Sandwich, and so on. Android fans
are always trying to predict what
the next name will be. Google even
got in on the fun with this teaser
Video for Android 5.0. What you
may not know is the first couple
versions of Android actually weren't
named after desserts. At least
not intentionally. Android 1.0 was
sometimes called "Alpha" or "Astro
Boy" while Android 1.1 technically
had a dessert name, but not in the
order that we know today. It was
known internally as "Petite Four,
which is a small French appetizer.
Android 1.5 "Cupcake" was the first
version to have an official dessert
nickname and so began the naming
Scheme we see today. The "A" and
"B dessert names for Android 1.0
and 1.1 will never be known but if
 we had to guess which names they
would have used , perhaps  "apple
pie" and banana split " are pretty
obvious . what would you guess?

 <h5>5. Android 3.0 is the only
version to never run on
phones</h5>
 Today Android is built to run on
many different types of hardware
ConfigurationS in all shapes and
sizes. Everything from phones,
tablets, watches, cars, TVs- you
name it. But that hasn't always been
the case. In 2010, Apple announced
the original iPad and the tech world
instantly had tablet fever. Android
manufacturers wanted to cash in
on the tablet frenzy but at the time,
the OS was only suited for smaller
screened devices like smartphones.
It didn't stop some manufacturers
from giving it a shot. Samsung
had some luck using Android 2.3
Gingerbread on the mid-sized
Galaxy Tab 7.0, but if Android was
going to compete with the 10-inch
iPad it needed a major Overhaul and
at CES 2011, the world got its first
look at Android 3.0 Honeycomb
running on the Motorola XOOM.
Honeycomb featured a completely
redesigned user interface, one made
especially for tablets. With a dark
"Holo UI," and larger interactive
widgets, the Android version was
still considered a failure in some
respects. While every manufacturer
on the face of the Earth was
making Android tablets, they were
expensive and lacked proper tablet-
dedicated apps. Google would
eventually scrap Honeycomb and
built future versions of Android
starting with lce Cream Sandwich
to work on all screen sizes. One of
the lasting features of Honeycomb
Is the on-screen nav buttons we still
use to this day
 <h5>6. First Android phone
didn't even have a virtual
keyboard or 3.5mm
headset jack</h5>
If you would go back to 2008
and tell the world that nearly all
smartphones in the future wouldn't
have physical keyboards- you
would be laughed at. During this
time the most popular phone was
a BlackBerry, which of Course had
an iconic physical keyboard. The
idea of a device without physical
keys didn't become popular until
the original iPhone, but even then
there were many skeptics. In fact,
the first Android device the T-
Mobile G1 came equipped with a
slide-out physical keyboard, but you
might be more surprised to learn
what it didn't have. The G1 shipped
with Android 1.1 which, at the time
didn't feature a virtual keyboard for
typing on the screen. You absolutely
had to use the physical keyboard to
type, which meant you couldn't do
any one-handed typing in portrait
mode. It wasn't until six months
later with the release of Android
1.5 that the G1 finally added a
virtual keyboard. The other feature
lacking from the T-Mobile G1 was
a big one that couldn't be fixed
with a simple software update: the
headphone jack. HTC inexplicably
did not include a traditional 3.5mnm
headphone jack in the G1. Instead,
the phone came with a proprietary
adapter you had to use meaning
you wouldn't listen to music and
charge the phone at the same time
This was a common complaint in the
initial reviews for the T-Mobile G1
and strangely a foreshadowing of
things to come
 <h5>7. Android got Google's
CEO kicked off Apple's
board</h5>
Over time as competition between
iOS and Android has picked up,
the relationship between Apple
and Google wasn't so friendly.
This was most evident in 2009
when Google CEO Eric Schmidt
was forced to resign from Apple's
board of directors. Steve Jobs
had this to say: "Unfortunately, as
Google enters more of Apples core
businesses, with Android and now
Chrome OS, Eric's effectiveness
as an Apple board member will be
significantly diminished, since he will
have to recuse himself from even
larger portions of our meetings due
to potential conflicts of interest."
You can imagine there were a lot
of sensational headlines about this
story, but it makes a lot of sense.
What good is a board member
that can't be present at meetings
due to a conflict of interest? The
relationship between Google and
Apple Continued to heat up as years
went on, with Apple making the
Controversial decision to remove
Google Maps in iOs 6, resulting in
Google later blocking Apple's Own
3rd party YouTube app. Eventually
an agreement would be met where
Google would be allowed to offer
their apps in the App store, even
becoming the default search engine
in iOS for the hefty sum or $3-4
billion a year
 <h5>8. WebOS could have
destroyed Android</h5>
As we've already covered, people
were a bit skeptical of Android at
the very beginning. WeboS on the
other hand was universally praised
when it was announced. At that
time there were very few Android
devices available and by the time
WeiboS launched, Android 1.5 was
still fresh and no one had even heard
of the Motorola DROID. The timing
was perfect for Webos to stomp
out Android and become the true
Contender to iOS, at least that's
what critics believed. It might have
actually happened too if it wasn't
for a few strange decisions by Palm.
They launched the first WebOS
device on Sprint instead of one of
the big carriers and the marketing
Campaign was very strange to say
the least. Still, the Palm Pre sold very
well the first month, but suffered
from a steep drop off after that.
A Couple of months later verizon
would announce the Motorola
DROID and Apple was onto to
the iPhone 3GS. Palm and WebOS
fizzled out, Google continued
to improve Android, and now it
quickly dominated the world with
its open platform. google would
later hire the designer of webOS,
matias duarte, to help improve
android's interface and design. his
first big contribution? android 3.0
honeycomb's Holo UI.
<h5> 9. Sony made the first
Android smartwatch in
2010</h5>
In 2014, Google announced Android
Wear, a special version of Android
built especially for smartwatches.
Since then we've seen a bunch
of Android smartwatches flood
the market. You might think that
these are the first Android-based
smartwatches to have been made,
but one company beat everyone to
the punch. Way back in 2010 Sony
(Ericsson) launched the LiveView
watch. It connected with Android
phones to display Twitter timelines,
RSS feeds, SMS, and control the
phone's media player. Sony would
later launch the SmartWatch 2
in 2013 with many of the same
features. It wasn't until around this
time that Samsung launched their
first Android-based smartwatch but
Sony was first out the gate.
