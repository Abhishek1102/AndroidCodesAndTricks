<h5> How to use Data Saver</h5>

One of the key new features on Android
is the new system-wide Data Saver
mode that helps in reducing mobile data
usage. The feature works by restricting
apps from receiving or sending data
in the background. Your frequently
used apps will continue to have access
to data in the background, but the
frequency will be reduced to limit data
usage. Another unintended positive side
effect of using the Data Saver mode is
that it leads to a slight improvement in
battery life.
Here's how you can enable Data Saver
mode on your Android device:
Head over to Settings-> Data Usage ->
Data Saver.
Toggle the switch on the top right
corner to On, and you are done.

In case you don't want mobile data
usage to be restricted for certain apps,
you can always whitelist them from
the Data Saver mode by using the
Unrestricted data access option.
