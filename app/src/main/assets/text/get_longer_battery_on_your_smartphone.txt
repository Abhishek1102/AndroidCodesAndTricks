ver there for  update. say for example,

<h5> 7. Selective synchronization of data</h5>
For enhanced battery life it is important
to  h ave a look at what is being
automatically synced across all your
devices. Say for example whenever you
take a photo it would be automatically
uploaded and result in huge battery
drain. So to conserve your battery
selectively choose on what all need
to be synced. The path is <h4>Settings>
Accounts> Google> Synchronization</h4>.

<h5> 8.Adjust brightness levels</h5>
The battery backup of your device
depends on the  brightness  level you
set. It is advised to set brightness

path is Setting>Display>Adaptive
brightness(enable).

And theme, which are graphically
intense consume a lot of RAM while running
 and consume a lot of battery. We recommend
  less intensive launcher such as Apex or nova to conserve your battery.
