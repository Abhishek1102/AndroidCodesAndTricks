 <h5>Application not found for all apps on
SD, why is that?</h5>
 This is one of the major pitfalls
of moving apps to SD-if the SD
malfunctions or gets unexpectedly
removed, it can break the app. Did you
Unmount the card before removing
it (in Settings>Storage)? Try going to
Settings>Apps , select one of those
apps, and see if you can Move to Phone
Storage again. If that works, then tap
Move to SD card afterwards to see if
that fixes it.

Otherwise, you may have to uninstall the
app, then reinstall it again. I am not sure
if the leftover app data on the SD card
will get incorporated correctly into the
reinstalled app, or if it will get confused

 <h5>Restore my phone book contacts</h5>
If you ever used G Mail, it means your
contacts are synchronized in your
Gmail account, if you want to restore to
your new phone, follow this: put your
Gmail account over your new phone
and switch the synchronization to on
position, once the synchronization
completes you will see all the contacts
will appear on your new phone.

 <h5>Sound get lower when plug in
headphones</h5>
 Its a safety feature. Most phone
manufacturers are applying that
automatic volume re-leveling when
plugging in headphones to avoid loud,
sudden noises blasting into your ears,
preventing damage/hearing loss.


Samsung phones, for instance, not
only do that, but they also add a very
annoying (but very valid) warning
pop-up when you try to go over
a certain volume level while using
headphones. It pops up once per reboot
and there no way to disable, dismiss
permanently, or ignore it.

<h5> Disable Facebook Video Auto-Play On
Android</h5>
There is yet another Facebook feature
that can be quite annoying: video
auto-play. Not only do you not always
want to see what people are showing,
but this also uses up more of the data
and battery of your Android. Here is
how to disable this feature on Android.
To do this, swipe to the furthest tab
on the Facebook app for Android and
tap on App Settings. Right there under
the General Settings, tap on 'Video
Auto-Play' and set it to Off. Of course,
Facebook has it defaulted to On, but not
anymore!
