 Most phones are password-protected
which, ironically, cuts your chances of
getting a lost phone back. If someone
finds your phone, they'll have no way to
actually contact you.

Luckily, you can throw some basic
Contact information up on your
home screen. Start by navigating
to  Settings>>Security & Screen
Lock>> Owner Info, then simply type the
information you'd want someone who
found your phone to know.

 <h5>Find your lost phone with this handy app.</h5>
The information will always be displayed
on your phone lock screen.

An email address, home phone number,
or family members cell phone should be
enough to help you get in contact with
someone who finds your phone.
