 <h5>QUICK ANSWER</h5>
To retrieve lost files on Android, you
can use a few different methods to
recover your lost files, from simply
checking the recycle bin, checking
your cloud backups, using recovery
apps for PC or Android, and even
Contacting the developer. However,
it's important to remember that
there is no guarantee of retrieving
lost android files.
 <h5>Stop using your phone
and put it in Airplane
mode</h5>
Before you do anything else, the
most important thing to know about
Android data recovery is that you
should stop using your phone as
soon as possible. This will give you
the best chance of getting your file
back if it is lost.
When you delete a file, the data
isn't gone at all. Android just marks
the space where the information is
stored as "empty." That means you
won't find the file, and Android will
treat it as missing. It also means the
slots that once contained that data
are marked as ready to write over,
should new files need space. Only
when this happens,does the data
really become lost, and you can't get
it back.
This is why it is so important that
you stop using your phone and stop
taking new photos or installing new
apps. We would highly recommend
that you put your phone in airplane
mode. This way, you will prevent
it from downloading emails,
whatsApp photos, and updates.
 <h5>Check your recycle bin</h5>
If you are lucky, you Won't have
deleted your files at all. Just like
a PC, many Android apps have
a recycle bin, meaning that files
are not completely removed right
away. for example, the Gallery app
that ships with Samsung phones
have such a safety net (this can
also explain why deleting photos is
not freeing up any space on your
device
To check the recycle bin, you need
to return to the top level on the
Pictures or Albums tab and tap the
menu in the top right. This will open
up a menu that includes a Recycle
Bin option. Select it, and you'll be
taken to a folder with all of your
deleted photos.
Other apps also have this option,
Such as the popular file manager
Astro File Manager. Whichever app
you used to delete the file, check
thoroughly to see if it has a recycle
bin.
 <h5>Check cloud backup</h5>
Google Photos also has a bin
that stores photos for 60 days,
but it works a little bit differently
by backing up your photos to
Google Drive. This means even if
you completely deleted a photo
Via another app, it may still be
salvageable via Google Photos.
If you don't see your photo or
video here, check the bin from the
hamburger menu in the top left. If
you still don't have any luck, then try
visiting photos.google.com. Check
the Trash folder from the hamburger
menu too Even it you remove your
photos from the bin in Google
Photos, there is still a chance these
changes haven't yet been reflected
in Google Drive. So check quickly
here, too. Something you may not
know about Google Drive is you can
ask it to back up any folder on your
device. Just open Photos->Settings-
Back up and Sync->Back up device
folders.Of course, many other apps
Such as Gmail will also store your
files on the cloud by default.
 <h5>How to retrieve
WhatsApp photos</h5>
If it's a WhatsApp photo you
accidentally deleted, there are
several options to try and get those
photos back. First, check the backup
built into WhatsApp itself. Head to
Settings > Chats > Chat Backup.
You should see some information
telling you when the last backup
was carried out. If it was recent,
uninstall the app and reinstall it from
the Play Store. This will then give
you the option to restore your old
chats and media. You'll also see the
option to backup photos to Google
Drive, so try looking here too if that
option is enabled.But what if you
accidentally wrote over your last
backup? Even then, there is still
hope. That's because whatsApp will
keep several backup files on your
device telling it which photos to
retrieve from the servers. Use the file
browser of your choice and head to
WhatsApp->Databases. Here, you
will see several files with names IIke
store-2022-01-05.crypt12. Find
the most recent one and rename
it to store-1997.crypt12 (or
whatever you like). Now WhatsApp
will defer to the second most recent
backup file when retrieving your
photos.You can also look in the
WhatsApp media folder in your
Google Photos library to see if your
photos are there. WhatsApp stores
copies of the photos you send, as
well as the ones you receive. So if
you sent someone a photo but then
deleted it from your phone's camera
folder, there may still be a copy in
the WhatsApp Media folder.
 <h5>Try Android data recovery
apps</h5>
If neither of these steps worked,
then you will need to start trying
third-party solutions. Android data
recovery apps can sometimes
retrieve data that has been lost. It
works by looking where data has
been stored even when marked as
deleted by Android. This is where
it becomes important that you
stop using your phone as much as
possible to avoid corrupting the
data that you're trying to recover
It also means you're in a bit of a
catch22, though, as installing a third-
party data recovery app on your
smartphone might cause you to
override the files you're trying to
save. To prevent this problem, you
should always try using a desktop
Computer recovery app first. We
recommend Recuva as a good place
to start. Install this app, and the
Wizard will then take you through
several steps to try and recover your
lost files. This method of Android
data recovery works a little better
for files stored on memory cards
instead of files that were stored
internally.
 <h5>Android data recovery
services</h5>
Depending on how desperate and
wealthy you are, another option
may be to use a data recovery
service. These services offer to
recover data from any device using
various methods. For example, one
company called On track promises
"if data can be stored on it, we
can recover it" and boasts a 90%
Success rate. These companies need
to collect your device in person and
Will likely use a combination of the
strategies listed here, along with
the afferentIroned file restoration
processes.The good news is you will
only be charged if they assess that
the file is recoverable. The only issue
is they are a lot more expensive than
other options on this list, so you
need to think long and hard about
whether you need those files.
<h5> Contact the developer</h5>
This is something of a long shot, but
if your lost files belonged to a game
or an app that you downloaded
from the Play Store, then you may
be able to get them back with a
bit of help from the developer.
That is because developers will
manage (or at least have access
to) the servers that contain cloud
backups of files. Not only that
but they may also know of some
sneaky backups their apps make
by default. Either way, there's a slim
chance they will be able to retrieve
the lost files from your account or
provide directions to help you do
So yourself.Unfortunately, there is
never a guarantee to retrieve lost
Android files. With a bit of luck and
determination, though, there is at
least a reasonable chance. But we
want to end with a word of caution
- losing files is a highly frustrating
and emotional experience. When
we're frustrated and emotional, we
can sometimes make rash decisions

smelt1 and do things we usually would
not. So if you are thinking about
spending hundreds of dollars on file
restoration software that likely was

smelt1 not work, or you have wasted hours
trying to recover work that only you

maybe its time to get some prespective.
any work you try to recreate will come
quicker ( and probably better) the second
time around. and you will still have memories
to help make up photos you might have lost.
just do not drive yourself mad over it.
