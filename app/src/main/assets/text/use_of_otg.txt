Display is broken but you can still see
the display
If you have broken your touchscreen but
the display is still working (you can see
it), you can fix this by using a USB OTG
and a mouse connected to your device.

Once you have connected the mouse,
you can unlock your device regardless
of whether you have a pattern, PIN
or password. We recommend using
passwords anyways because they are
highly secure.

can connect it to your computer and
either transfer the data you need to your
microSD memory or connect it directly
to your PC and transfer the files there.
