 Your phone data usage can be tough
to track. If your 4G network is quick
enough, you could potentially be
downloading files at the same speed
as your home Internet. Luckily, Android
comes with a packed-in data usage
notification system.

<h5> Avoid common data plan mistakes that
could cost you big .
First, navigate to Settings>>Data Usage.</h5>
You will see a graph that displays your
data usage, along with a yellow and red
bar.

The yellow bar designates when your
phone will warn you about your data
usage. The red is a hard cap on your
data to avoid overage fees.

The red line should be your
Smartphones monthly data limit. If
you don not know your data limit, you
should contact your cell carrier as soon
as possible.
