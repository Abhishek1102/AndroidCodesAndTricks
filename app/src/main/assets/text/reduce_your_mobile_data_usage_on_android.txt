 <h5>Reduce your mobile data usage on android</h5>

You can follow these tips for the
apps you use the most or your
particular usage habits.

Compress Chrome pages

If you use Chrome for all your web
traffic, this tip alone can save you
30 to 35 percent of your mobile
browser data consumption. The Data
Saver option compresses web pages
before loading them in your browser.

Using Data Saver does slow things
down a tiny bit, but you quickly get
used to it and a moments delay is
worth it when your data lasts so
much longer. Just launch Chrome,
tap the three dots in the top right
hand corner, go down to Settings
and then to Data Saver. Keep an
eye on the graph to see your data
savings grow.

  <h5>Use Opera video compression </h5>
The Opera for Android browser now
has a very useful video compression
option, which can save you a load of
data if you're frequently watching
videos on the go. To use it, simply
download the Opera browser, go to
Settings> Data savings  and tick the
box that says Video compression.
this setting not only saves you data,
but also means that videos are
more likely to load faster

  <h5>Ditch the Facebook app </h5>
Its pretty well known among
Android aficionados that the
Facebook app is one of the biggest
Consumers of data, not to mention
its high resource use and battery
drain. So why not replace it with
something less demanding?

There are lots of alternate Facebook
apps but many of those are just
as hungry as the official version.
Even Facebook Lite, which claims
to reduce data consumption by
50 percent, still chews through
hundreds of MB in a month.

So why not try Tinfoil for Facebook,
which is simply a web app that
displays the Facebook website or
you could simply create a Chrome
shortcut in your web browser. Just
open Facebook in Chrome, open the
Overflow menu and select Add to
Home Screen.

  <h5>Make use of offline apps, games and services </h5>

Some apps and games require
Constant internet access to function:
this can be simply a security
measure or because they constantly
need to retrieve data. There are
Some apps and games that do not
require internet access at all after
the initial download.

Check out below for some hints

  <h5>Restrict background data </h5>
The easiest way to save data is
to tell your apps (or the Android
system itself) to restrict background
data. Background data is all that
internet traffic that goes on when
you are not atually using an app:
email syncing, feeds updating,
weather widgets and so on.

You can also tell the Android system
to restrict background data in
 <h5>Settings > Data usage > Restrict
Background Data or for individual
apps in Settings Apps  (depending
on which version of Android you
have). You can also change your
sync settings for Google services
in Settings > Accounts > Google
>select the account  and then un-
check the services you don't want to
sync automatically.

  <h5>Disable auto-updating apps </h5>
Another huge drain of your
data allowance comes from the
occasional bout of Google Play
app updating. If you have the Play
Store set to auto-update apps, even
Over a data connection, this could
be chewing its way through your
allowance every month without you
even knowing.

To check, go to the Play Store and
Swipe out the left-hand navigation
drawer. Tap Settings and at the top,
you will see Auto-Update Apps. Tap
this and make sure you either have
it set to Do not auto-update apps or
Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only.
To manage individual apps go to my
Apps, select an app and then tap
the overflow menu to check, or un-
check Auto-Update.

   <h5>Put some music on your phone </h5>
Streaming services like YouTube
Spotify, Vine and other video and
music sites are huge data killers
If there a tune or album you are
Constantly listening to at the gym
or on the way to work, you will use
much less data by loading it onto
your phone and listening to it offline,
than endlessly streaming it from the
web.

If your phone does not have a
micro SD card or enough space
in its internal memory for you to
Save music, you can use a micro SD
adapter. Alternatively, you can save
music for offline listening. It will
not require as much space on your
phone and is easy to get rid of or
replace later. If you Can curb your
streaming cravings, even just a little,
you will see a huge reduction in data
Consumption.

   <h5>Identify and limit/remove high
consuming apps</h5>

In Settings > Data usage you can
get a look at the apps which are
Consuming the most data both in
the foreground and the background.
This can be really useful for knowing
which apps you should restrict.

Take Gmail, for example. On my
phone, it has downloaded 451 MB of
emails in the background. If I felt I
did not use the app enough to justify
that much data use, I Could remove
the app, limit how often it syncs
or prevent it from downloading
attachments, all of which would
reduce data consumption.

<h5>Do not upload, download or send
pictures or videos</h5>

A single minute of high definition
footage captured on a modern
smartphone can take up as much
as 200 MB of data. Single photos
Can easily exceed 40 MB. Do not
even think about uploading these to
Facebook, or downloading pictures
and videos from friends, unless your
mobile data plan can handle it.

 <h5>Make use of Wi-Fi hotspots</h5>
Open Wi-Fi networks are a great
way to save data when you are
out and about. More restaurants
and eateries are providing Wi-Fi
connectivity all the time and these
hotspots are easy to find on your
android device.

In your Wi-Fi menu (easily found
with a two-finger downward swipe
from the top of your phone on
Lollipop/Marshmallow) any Wi-Fi
access point which does not feature
a lock icon is open and has the
potential to be accessed without
entering any details or passcodes.
Simply tap one such hotspot when
you see it to connect. There is a
potential for people to listen in on
your online interactions over these
networks - but this just means you
should exercise caution. Do not
enter sensitive information in such
Situations, or access private material
Or if do wish to do this, you could
make use of a VPN app to keep you
private and secure.

 <h5>Share photos, videos and other files
via Bluetooth</h5>
As we mentioned in point 10, just
receiving photos and videos can
consume a lot of data. But transfers
over mobile network is not the only
way to send files. Thanks to the
magic of Bluetooth, you can quickly
nd easily send relatively large files
to others in your vicinity without
using any data at all.

Of course, proximity is one of the
limitations of Bluetooth, but when
the intended recipient is close by,
this could be a huge data saver.

To send something via Bluetooth
you must navigate to the item you
wish to send and then hit the share
button (looks like this) or select
share from the options menu. The
way to do it will depend on the item
you are sending.

Next, select the Bluetooth icon.
If your Bluetooth is not enabled,
you may be prompted to enable
it. Finally, you must select the
destination device from a list of
nearby Bluetooth-enabled gadgets.
Note that the destination device
must also have Bluetooth enabled,
and you must know it's name to find
it in the list.
